# Donehub
### created with Vite, Reactjs, Typescript and Firebase
this project was created in 2021 when I first started with react and ts, I never really release it to the public due to lack of typescript type system and hosting it to vercel. I found this on my hard-drive and think "yea this is good enough and edit a few css style to fit my currect vision (the old one looks ass)"
